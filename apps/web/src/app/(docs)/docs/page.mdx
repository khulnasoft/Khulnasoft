# KhulnaSoft Documentation
Here you'll find all the guides, concepts, and SDK references for developing with KHULNASOFT.

<CodeGroup isTerminalCommand>
```bash {{ language: 'js' }}

```
```bash {{ language: 'python' }}
pip install khulnasoft-code-interpreter
```
</CodeGroup>

## What is KHULNASOFT?
KhulnaSoft is an [open-source](https://github.com/khulnasoft) infrastructure that allows you to run AI-generated code in secure isolated sandboxes in the cloud.
To start and control sandboxes, use our [Python SDK](https://pypi.org/project/khulnasoft/) or [JavaScript SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/khulnasoft). {{ className: 'lead' }}

Some of the typical use cases for KhulnaSoft are AI data analysis or visualization, running AI-generated code of various languages, playground for coding agents, environment for codegen evals, or running full AI-generated apps like in [Fragments](https://github.com/khulnasoft/fragments).

### Under the hood
The KhulnaSoft Sandbox is a small isolated VM the can be started very quickly (~150ms). You can think of it as a small computer for the AI model. You can run many sandboxes at once. Typically, you run separate sandbox for each LLM, user, or AI agent session in your app.
For example, if you were building an AI data analysis chatbot, you would start the sandbox for every user session.
