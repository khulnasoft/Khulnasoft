# SDK Reference

This is the SDK reference for the [KhulnaSoft CLI & Core SDK](https://github.com/khulnasoft/khulnasoft), [Code Interpreter SDK](https://github.com/khulnasoft/code-interpreter), and [Desktop Sandbox SDK](https://github.com/khulnasoft/desktop).

The reference is intended to be limited to low-level descriptions of various programmatic functionality. If youâ€™re just getting started with KHULNASOFT, we would instead recommend looking at the [documentation](/docs) first or to get started quickly with an example.
